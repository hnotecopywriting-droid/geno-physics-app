# 🧬 Geno-Physics: 3D RNA Structural Ensemble
### Co-developed with Gemini (Google AI)

This project bridges structural biology with fundamental physics equations.

## 🧪 The Physics-Geno Markers
| Marker | Equation | Duality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FE-Q** | $F_e = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$ | Pos (+) vs. Neg (-) |
| **Q-MCT** | $Q = mc\Delta T$ | Hot vs. Cold |
| **F-EXT_INT** | $\sum F = Ma$ | Internal vs. External |

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`🧬 Geno-Physics: 3D RNA Structural EnsemblePredicting the Dualities of Life through Physics-Geno MarkersThis project introduces a novel framework for visualizing RNA structural predictions by mapping fundamental physics dualities ("The Big Twos") onto experimental structural data. Using PDB: 1EBQ as the ground truth, we visualize the interplay between thermodynamics, electrostatics, and mechanical forces within a 29-residue helix.🧪 The Physics-Geno MarkersMarkerEquationDualityBiological FocusFE-Q$F_e = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$Pos (+) vs. Neg (-)Electrostatic BindingQ-MCT$Q = mc\Delta T$Hot vs. ColdThermal FlexibilityF-EXT_INT$\sum F = Ma$Internal vs. ExternalStructural Integrity🚀 The 5-Truth EnsembleThis application allows researchers to toggle between five distinct conformational "truths," each representing a different physical state of the RNA strand, aligned using US-align logic ($d_0 = 0.7$).
