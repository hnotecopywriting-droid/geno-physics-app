# 🧬 The Influence Matrix: RNA-RNP 3D Folding Simulator

### *Predicting 175,000-Residue RNA Structures via Environmental Influence Sliders*

## 📜 Project Overview
This project, developed for the **Stanford RNA 3D Folding Challenge**, introduces a dynamic predictive model for large-scale Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) structures. Moving beyond static sequence analysis, this application simulates how outside environmental "pressures" dictate the globular folding patterns of RNA-RNP condensates (the "Rockefeller" model).

### 💡 The Counseling Metaphor
As a project rooted in **Systems Counseling**, this model treats RNA not as a fixed blueprint, but as a living system in a constant state of negotiation with its environment. Just as external life pressures shape human behavior, environmental stressors shape the 3D geometry of the molecule.

## ⚙️ How It Works: The 10-Slider System
The application utilizes a **100% Reaction Rule** to bridge the gap between external influences and internal structural responses.

### 🌍 The 5 Outer Influences (Inputs)
1. **Mechanical Pressure:** Cellular crowding and volumetric compaction.
2. **Thermal/Radiative:** Kinetic energy and filament excitation.
3. **Vibrational Resonance:** Acoustic impact on structural oscillation.
4. **Temporal/Circadian:** Time-lapse folding and degradation.
5. **Biodemographic:** Stochastic environmental variables.

### 🧬 The 5 Inner Responses (Outputs)
- **RA Nodes 1-3:** Interactive "chromosomal hairs" that bend and glow.
- **Emergent Nodes 4-5:** Speculative internal folding responses.

## 🧪 The Mathematics
The model calculates the x, y, z coordinates of the C1' atoms using a weighted influence matrix:
**R_n = (I_x * 1.0) + Σ(I_other * w)**
*Where w is the "Weighted Sympathy" (10-35%) assigned to secondary filaments.*
